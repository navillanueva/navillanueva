### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, IÂ´m Nico 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Computer Scientist graduate as of July of 2022
- ðŸŒ± I did my studies at Universidad Carlos 3 de Madrid, and studied one year abroad at Hanyang University, in South Korea
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m currently focusing on learning solidity and javascript to further my knowledge in the web3 space
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that seems interesting! I am still exploring what I like.
- ðŸ’¬ Check out this web3-related association called [The Block](https://www.linkedin.com/in/the-block-b7138123a/) I started at my University to group together like-minded students 
- ðŸ“« You can also reach me personally through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicol%C3%A1s-arnedo-villanueva-454a36169/)


*Brief rundown of my portafolio*
You will see most of my repositories will start with uc3m, which stands for the university I studied. Since this has been my main focus during the past years, the gran mayority of my repos are university-related projects. Some are a bit messy, some dont have the datasets because I cant access them anymore and so forth. The later ones tend to be a bit more up-to-date and functional, but it has been quite the process.
Any other repo you find without uc3m at the beginnig is most likely to be a little project I decided to do. As I grow and learn as a computer scientist, I promise you my GitHub repos will also get better! 
Thanks for taking the time to check my profile out and have a good day :)
